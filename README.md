# Fire Detector

The Fire Detector Model is an advanced system developed as part of the Quality Control and Computer Vision course. This project integrates cutting-edge computer vision techniques with temperature monitoring to achieve real-time fire detection. The model is trained using a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network, a deep learning architecture known for its accuracy in image recognition tasks. By leveraging a combination of visual data and input from a temperature sensor, the system ensures high reliability in identifying fire incidents.

The hardware implementation utilizes an Arduino microcontroller, which processes sensor data and interacts with the detection algorithm. When a fire is detected, the system immediately triggers a buzzer alarm, providing an audible alert to ensure timely intervention. This innovative project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning and embedded systems in safety-critical scenarios, offering a robust and efficient solution for fire monitoring and prevention.
